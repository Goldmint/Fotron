# Fotron
D-App exchange for Tron network.

__Fotron__ is a marketplace, which is used by different projects for TRC10/20 token sales. Our platform shares common principles of tokens distribution, which are anchored on open and audited smart-contract:

__Escrow__ - holding TRX tokens that were received from selling of other tokens with the possibility of reverse selling until lockup period ends.

__Referral system__ - we pay TRX rewards for recruiting new customers.

__Liquidity and pricing__ - depends on made purchases and returns, the price is dynamically changing and displayed in TRX equivalent. It is possible to buy back all previously sold tokens as well.

__Gamification__ - token buyers receive extra bonuses pegged to the point of purchase.
