The amount of fee depends on the deal size: bigger deals - higher fees.<br><br>The process is reversible: investors may turn back purchased tokens into TRX in compliance with the actual price at any point of lockup period. Investors may keep tokens or sell them on any crypto exchange. It is also possible to buy tokens on a crypto exchange and sell them into the smart-contract, but no more than their platform purchases volume.<br><br>The project is able to receive funds from the smart-contract (unsold tokens and/or TRX) after the lockup period ends."
